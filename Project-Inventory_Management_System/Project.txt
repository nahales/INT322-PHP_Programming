INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM in PHP 

• Created select parts of a web-based inventory management system, such as might be used as part of an online store
 
• Implemented the PHP code in three main programs:

	1. add (validates the input data and adds to database)
	2. delete (If is not already deleted, deletes its record in database) 
	3. view (displays all records in database based on the searched specifications, in a tabular format)
